**Key Milestone/Celebration:** Created a PostgreSQL database for use in my project.

## What I Did Today
---
- Created a PostgreSQL database for my stock price alerts system.
- Designed an `alerts` table to store stock price alerts.
- Manually ran SQL queries to add and remove stock alerts from the `alerts` table to ensure proper table functionality.
- Started creating backend routes for DB management in `server.py`

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- The `alerts` table has been created with the following columns:
  - `alert_id`
  - `ticker`
  - `price`
  - `direction`
  - `one_time`
  - `creation_date`
  - `expiration_date`
