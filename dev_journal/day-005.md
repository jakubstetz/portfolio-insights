**Key Milestone/Celebration:** 

## What I Did Today
---
- Tested all routes and new evaluation/triggering functionality. Fixed minor bugs.
- Refactored code and cleaned up comments.
- Merged the alerts_evaluation branch into main.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- 

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- For real-time database updates, `Connection.commit()` should be called after every write operation.

### What I Reinforced
- Merging branches in Git.
- Using Thunder Client to test API routes.

## Challenges
---
- Merging branches locally and remotely. I alsways seem to confuse something in this process and need more practice to be comfortable with it.
