# Day 009 - 12 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** 

## What I Did Today
---
- Finalized my commit tag convention and created `commit-conventions.md`.
- Finished the separate `hello-docker` project to practice for containerizing `portfolio-insights`.
- Cleaned up comments in all files, mostly moving them to above-line.
- Installed, set up, and ran Prettier.
- Installed, set up, and ran Black.
- Created Dockerfiles and a Docker Compose file.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- Started following commit tag conventions, because this is standard practice and I really like it as a valuable aspect of workflow organization.
- Will be using separate Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend and then Docker Compose to build a synthesized image using both together. This allows for clear but bundled separation of concerns.

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- There are linting tools and commit format enforcement tools (e.g. Husky, `pre-commit`) that can be used to enforce commit formatting.
- How to use Docker Compose.
- What is Prettier and how to use it.
  - Uses `.prettierignore` to skip over certain files.
- What is Black and how to use it.
  - Uses `.gitignore` or `pyproject.toml` to skip over certain files.
- Prettier and Black syntax enforcements align with the best practices that are pretty much universally accepted in the world of software development. 
- What a `pyproject.toml` file is and how to use it.
- `.venv` is standard practice over `venv`.
- It is standard convention to write comments above-line rather than inline.

### What I Reinforced
- Using commit tags.
- Creating Docker images and running Docker containers.
