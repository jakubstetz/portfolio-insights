# Day 004 - 07 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** 

## What I Did Today
---
- Replaced docstring `'''` enclosures with `"""`.
- Finalized implementation of alert management routes and functions in `server.py` and `alerts.py`, respectively, Including error handling and SQL query string input placeholders.
  - `GET` for retrieving a stock price alert by id.
  - `POST` for creating a new stock price alert.
  - `DELETE` for deleting a stock price alert by id.
  - `PATCH` for updating a stock price alert by id.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- Will be using input placeholders in SQL queries executed using the `psycopg` library, for security and to follow standard practice.

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- PEP 257 recommends that all Python docstrings be enclosed in `"""` rather than `'''`.
- Fetching data from `SELECT` SQL queries run through the `psycopg` library.
- How to use input placeholders for SQL query strings in the `psycopg` library.

### What I Reinforced
- Using input placeholders in SQL queries constructed in Python code.

## Notes to Future Me
---
- According to PEP 257, docstrings should be enclosed in `"""` rather than `'''`. This is good for me to keep in mind for the future.
