# Day 001 - 04 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** 

## What I Did Today
---
- Created issues in GitHub to clarify the path forward.
- Cleaned up filesystem. Renamed folders, moved things around, created a `.env` file, and adjusted frontend root folder in `vite.config.js`.
- Decided on `yfinance` as my stock price API and started working with it.
- Created basic new routes in `server.py` to better understand how FastAPI implements roots and to create a scaffolding for future functionality.
- Connected `server.py` routes to `yfinance_functions.py` functions.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- I will containerize the backend using Docker.
  - This will allow me to both practice and express the essential skill of containerization with Docker.
- Have `backend` and `frontend` folders.
  - Allows for clean, readable, straightforward separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
- Will use the Yahoo Finance stock API.
  - It has extensive documentation.
  - It's well-known, with a large userbase.
  - It is easy to set up, with no API keys or sign-up needed. It can be accessed simply through the `yfinance` library.
  - It has generous rate limits (60 GET requests per minute).

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- `vite.config.js` can be used to configure how Vite runs. In the case of this project I used it to change the name of the frontend root folder from `src` to `frontend`.
- Learned how to create routes and use path parameters and query strings in FastAPI.
  - FastAPI uses name-matching to connect a request function parameter with the path parameter provided.
- Learned about Python decorators.
- Learned about pip, which is the Python equivalent of npm.

### What I Reinforced
- Restful API creation using routes.
- Connecting server routes with backend functions.

## Challenges
---
- 

## Issues
---
### Created
---
- [[Feature] Dockerize backend](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/3)
- [[Feature] Set up usage of a stock price API](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/4)
- [[Feature] Implement stock price historical data retrieval by symbol](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/5)

### Resolved
---
- [[Feature] Create basic API routes in FastAPI server](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/2)

## Next Steps
---
- 

## Notes to Future Me
---
- It would be beneficial for me to go through the FastAPI documentation more deeply eventually to better understand the nuances of how this library works.
- It would be beneficial for me to go through the Vite documentation more deeply eventually so that I can better understand how it works and how I can fine-tune it for my specialized needs.
- I should study up on including types in Python definitions and make that a practice in this project.
- I should consider what error handling should be done in `server.py` vs. `yfinance_functions.py`
