# Day 001 - 04 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** Linking together API routes with `yfinance` functionalities.

## What I Did Today
---
- Created issues in GitHub to clarify the path forward.
- Cleaned up filesystem. Renamed folders, moved things around, created a `.env` file, and adjusted frontend root folder in `vite.config.js`.
- Decided on `yfinance` as my stock price API and started working with it.
- Created basic new routes in `server.py` to better understand how FastAPI implements roots and to create a scaffolding for future functionality.
- Connected `server.py` routes to `yfinance_functions.py` functions.
- Executed first methods from `yfinance` library. I'm able to print stock information in my browser based on my URL path parameters!
  - Set up a `/info` endpoint in `server.py` to return stock information by ticker.

## Key Decisions & Why
---
- I will containerize the backend using Docker.
  - This will allow me to both practice and express the essential skill of containerization with Docker.
- Have `backend` and `frontend` folders.
  - Allows for clean, readable, straightforward separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
- Will use the Yahoo Finance stock API.
  - It has extensive documentation.
  - It's well-known, with a large userbase.
  - It is easy to set up, with no API keys or sign-up needed. It can be accessed simply through the `yfinance` library.
  - It has generous rate limits (60 GET requests per minute).
- I will have price alerts as a key feature of my program.
  - This feature allows me to readily practice database management and dealing with various user API requests.
- I will work with a local PostgreSQL server and then migrate it to the cloud.
  - I am familiar with working locally with PostgreSQL and so I can readily use it for this application.
  - Migrating to the cloud later allows me to practice what I know about AWS.

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- `vite.config.js` can be used to configure how Vite runs. In the case of this project I used it to change the name of the frontend root folder from `src` to `frontend`.
- How to create routes and use path parameters and query strings in FastAPI.
  - FastAPI uses name-matching to connect a request function parameter with the path parameter provided.
- What are Python decorators and how to use them.
- What is pip, which is the Python equivalent of npm.
- The basics of using `yfinance`.
- What is `requirements.txt` and how to use it.

### What I Reinforced
- Restful API implementation using routes.
- Connecting server routes with backend functions.
- Creating and resolving GitHub Issues.

- [[Feature] Implement caching of previously-accessed historical data](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/6)
- [[Feature] Generate requirements.txt](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/8)
- [[Feature] Implement query-based stock data retrieval](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/9)
- [[Feature] Create a basic frontend to allow alert management](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/10)
- [[Feature] Create user stock price alert management functionality](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/11)
- [[Feature] Create a database to manage user stock price alerts and integrate with backend](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/12)
- [[Feature] Make initial deployment on AWS](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/13)

### Resolved
---
- [[Feature] Create basic API routes in FastAPI server](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/2)
- [[Feature] Generate requirements.txt](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/8)
- [[Feature] Set up usage of a stock price API](https://github.com/jakubstetz/portfolio-insights/issues/4)

## Next Steps
---
- Create a stock price alert management system consisting of a dabatase, API routes, and a frontend.

## Notes to Future Me
---
- It would be beneficial for me to go through the FastAPI documentation more deeply eventually to better understand the nuances of how this library works.
- It would be beneficial for me to go through the Vite documentation more deeply eventually so that I can better understand how it works and how I can fine-tune it for my specialized needs.
- I should study up on including types in Python definitions and make that a practice in this project.
- I should consider what error handling should be done in `server.py` vs. `yfinance_functions.py`.
