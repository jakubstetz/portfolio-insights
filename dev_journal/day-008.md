# Day 008 - 11 April 2025
---
**Key Milestone/Celebration:** I have a fully functional UI!

## What I Did Today
---
- Implemented conditional retrieval of stock price alerts using a search term.
- Standardized the output of the `alerts.py` `search` function and the associated `server.py` route to be JSON-friendly.
- Updated frontend to properly receive and use the new alert format returned by my API.
- Cleaned up API calls in `AlertsArea.jsx`, adding error handling and removing redundant code.
- Implemented UI-based creation of an alert.
- Implemented UI-based deletion of an alert.
- Implemented automatic refresh of alerts display on creation of new alert and on deletion of an alert.
- Implemented automatic reset of alerts search bar input on creation of new alert and on deletion of an alert.

## Key Decisions & Why

## What I Learned or Reinforced
---
### What I Learned
- Using `LIKE` and `ILIKE` in PostgreSQL to search for strings that contain a given substring.
- `Connection.cursor.description` can be used to return column data for database entries returned using `.execute`.
- When `dict(zip(list1, list2))` is used in Python, Python will automatically know to use the first list as the dictionary keys.
- FastAPI's `response_model` is used for client response validation, serialization, and documentation.
- `status_code` and the `fastapi.status` class can be used to automatically specify status codes in API responses.
- Implemented reset of `AlertsArea` search bar upon alert deletion or creation.

### What I Reinforced
- Returning proper status codes and messages in API responses to client, and formatting responses to be JSON-friendly.
- Working with CORS (in this case, for `POST` and `DELETE` requests).
- Error-handling in API calls.
- Using form data in API calls.
- Handling progressive changes to a state using `prev` or `...prev`.
- Implementing communication and handling of states between React components.
- Using React effect hooks.
